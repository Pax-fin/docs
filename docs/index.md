# Pax Technical Wiki

The landing page for developers. Documentation should be reviewed and versioned control. Oh, and this is free!

## Navigation

You can either use the search bar or use the navigation bar to find your documents. At worse, you can always grep the
repository.

## Usage

- The [mkdocs website](https://www.mkdocs.org/) is very informative and a good starting place if you have never
  used `mkdocs`
- To see the good looks, we use the [material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) and you can look at
  its docs for any special UI components
- To add new pages, follow [the add a new document how-to](./how-to/add-a-new-documentation-page.md)

### Run locally

Ensure you have installed:

```shell
pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material
```

Then you can run a local server

```shell
mkdocs serve
```
