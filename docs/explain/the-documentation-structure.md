# Explain: The documentation structure

The documentation structure of the technical docs is inspired
from [the grand unified theory of documentation](https://documentation.divio.com/).

Basically, we categorize all documents into one of four types and then tailor or prose to fit that mold. From experience
the majority of docs fall into one of these 4 categories and we drive clarity for the reader by letting them know what
to expect in a document with a certain label.
